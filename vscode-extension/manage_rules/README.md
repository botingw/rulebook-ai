# üß© Manage Rules ‚Äì Universal **AI Coding Rules** Manager for VS Code

Bring **consistent, context-rich AI assistance** to every repo you touch‚Äîacross Cursor, GitHub Copilot, CLINE, RooCode & Windsurf‚Äîwithout leaving VS Code.

---

### ‚ú® Why you‚Äôll love it

- **One-click install** of a curated rule-set & ‚Äúmemory bank‚Äù that makes any AI assistant *project-aware*.
- **Works everywhere** your AI does: generates `.cursor/rules`, `.clinerules`, `.windsurf/rules`, Copilot instructions‚Äîautomatically.  
- **Always in sync**: update rules once, hit **Sync**, done.  
- **Clean exits**: nuke generated files or the whole framework with **Clean Rules / Clean All**.  
- **Zero-config**: Python script is bundled; respects your workspace‚Äôs Python path if you want.  
- **Open-source & extensible**: MIT-licensed, backed by the [Rulebook-AI](https://github.com/botingw/rulebook-ai) project.

> ‚ÄúFinally my Cursor and Copilot follow the same playbook.‚Äù ‚Äî Early adopter

2. Click the **Manage Rules** icon in the Activity Bar.  
3. Hit **Install Rule Set** ‚Üí pick `light-spec` (or any set).

## üí° How it works (under the hood)

The extension is a **thin Node.js wrapper** that triggers the backend `manage_rules.py` script inside VS Code‚Äôs Integrated Terminal. Six static commands in a sidebar cover all common workflows; anything else you can run via *Custom CLI*.‚Äã

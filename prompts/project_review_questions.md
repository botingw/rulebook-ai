# Project Review Questions

**A. Specification (spec) Document Review:**
*   **Clarity and Completeness:** Are the requirements clear, unambiguous, and complete? Are there any edge cases or user scenarios that might be missing?
*   **Feasibility:** Based on the project context, are the specified features technically feasible within the given constraints?
*   **Consistency:** Are there any conflicting requirements within this document?

**B. Task Plan Document Review:**
*   **Alignment:** Does the task plan accurately reflect the requirements laid out in the spec document? Is every feature from the spec accounted for in the tasks?
*   **Granularity:** Are the tasks broken down into appropriately small and manageable units of work?
*   **Dependencies:** Are task dependencies clearly identified? Is there a logical flow to the tasks?
*   **Estimation:** Do the time estimates (if any) seem reasonable for the complexity of the tasks?

**C. TDD Plan Document Review:**
*   **Test Coverage:** Does the TDD plan provide a clear strategy for testing the core features outlined in the spec? Does it cover unit, integration, and end-to-end testing appropriately?
*   **Clarity of Test Cases:** Are the example test cases clear and well-defined? Do they effectively describe the expected behavior of the system?
*   **Tooling:** Is the choice of testing frameworks and tools suitable for the project's tech stack?

**D. Implementation Plan Document Review:**
*   **Architecture:** Does the proposed architecture make sense for the project's goals and tech stack? Is it scalable and maintainable?
*   **Phasing:** Is the implementation broken down into logical phases or milestones? Does this align with the task plan?
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Does the plan identify potential technical risks (e.g., integrating a new API, complex algorithm) and suggest mitigation strategies?

**E. Overall Cohesion Review:**
*   **Consistency Across Documents:** Are the spec, task plan, TDD plan, and implementation plan consistent with each other? For example, does a feature mentioned in the spec have corresponding tasks, tests, and implementation details in the other documents?
*   **Potential Gaps:** Are there any noticeable gaps between these documents? For instance, is a complex implementation detail not backed by a clear requirement or test plan?
*   **Final Recommendations:** What are the top 3-5 most critical actions I should take to improve these documents before I start coding?

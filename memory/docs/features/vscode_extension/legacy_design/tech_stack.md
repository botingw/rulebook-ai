# VS Code Extension GUI Tech Stack Decision (MVP)

For the initial MVP of the VS Code extension GUI (Webview), the chosen technology stack is **Plain HTML, CSS, and TypeScript**.

**Rationale:**

*   **Simplicity:** This stack avoids the complexity and learning curve of full-fledged front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, which are not necessary for a simple single-page GUI.
*   **Direct VS Code Integration:** Plain web technologies integrate seamlessly with the VS Code Webview API for message passing between the extension backend (`extension.ts`) and the Webview frontend.
*   **Speed of Development:** For the initial GUI with basic buttons and output display, writing HTML, CSS, and TypeScript directly is the fastest approach.
*   **Consistency:** Using TypeScript for the Webview aligns with the language used for the extension's backend, promoting code consistency and maintainability.
*   **Type Safety:** TypeScript provides static type checking, which helps catch errors during development and improves code reliability, especially for message passing between the frontend and backend.
*   **Tooling:** The existing TypeScript build process for the extension can be extended to compile the Webview's TypeScript files.

**Implementation:**

*   HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files will be created for the Webview content.
*   The Webview panel in `extension.ts` will load the compiled JavaScript output from the TypeScript files.
*   Message passing between the Webview and `extension.ts` will be implemented using the VS Code Webview API (`postMessage`, `onDidReceiveMessage`).
*   TypeScript interfaces or types will be used to define the structure of messages passed between the frontend and backend, ensuring type safety.

**Future Considerations:**

If the GUI's complexity significantly increases in future iterations, a front-end framework might be re-evaluated to improve code management and developer productivity. However, for the MVP, Plain HTML, CSS, and TypeScript are the optimal choice.

# Refactoring Task Plan (As Executed)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This document breaks down the work performed during the internal refactoring of the `rulebook-ai` core and CLI components. The objective was to improve code modularity, maintainability, and extensibility by separating declarative assistant specifications from the file-generation engine.

This plan is a historical record of the tasks completed, based on the final design in the [Refactoring Plan](./refactoring_plan.md).

---

### Phase 1: Separate Specification from Logic

**Description:** This phase focused on creating a purely data-driven architecture, separating the "what" (the assistant spec) from the "how" (the generation engine).

| Task ID | Description                                                                              | Importance | Status      | Dependencies      |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------------|
| **1.1** | Define the `AssistantSpec` dataclass in a new `assistants.py` file.                      | P0         | Completed   | -                 |
| **1.2** | Create the `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS` list in `assistants.py` as the single source of truth. | P0         | Completed   | 1.1               |
| **1.3** | Refactor `RuleManager` in `core.py` into a generic engine that interprets `AssistantSpec` data. | P0         | Completed   | 1.2               |
| **1.4** | Implement private generation strategies (`_strategy_flatten_and_number`, etc.) in `RuleManager`. | P0         | Completed   | 1.3               |
| **1.5** | Refactor public methods (`install`, `sync`, `clean_rules`) to be data-driven and compliant with the design spec. | P0         | Completed   | 1.4               |

### Phase 2: Simplify and Automate the CLI

**Description:** This phase refactored the command-line interface to be dynamically generated from the single source of truth, eliminating hardcoded logic.

| Task ID | Description                                                                              | Importance | Status      | Dependencies      |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------------|
| **2.1** | Refactor `cli.py` to dynamically generate assistant flags (e.g., `--cursor`) from `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS`. | P1         | Completed   | 1.2               |
| **2.2** | Simplify `handle_install` and `handle_sync` to pass the list of selected assistants to `RuleManager`. | P1         | Completed   | 1.4, 2.1          |

### Phase 3: Verification and Documentation

**Description:** This final phase ensured that the refactoring was correct, robust, and fully documented.

| Task ID | Description                                                                              | Importance | Status      | Dependencies      |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------------|
| **3.1** | Manually test CLI commands to confirm compliance and identify bugs in the new logic.       | P0         | Completed   | 1.5, 2.2          |
| **3.2** | Run the full automated test suite (`pytest`) to identify all regressions.                  | P0         | Completed   | 3.1               |
| **3.3** | Fix all failing integration tests in `test_cli_commands.py` and other files to align with the new CLI behavior. | P0         | Completed   | 3.2               |
| **3.4** | Rewrite the unit tests in `test_rule_manager_unit.py` to validate the new core generation strategies. | P0         | Completed   | 3.3               |
| **3.5** | Update the public design spec (`manage_rules_script_design.md`) to include the new assistant-selection features. | P1         | Completed   | 3.4               |

### Enhancement: Additional Assistant Support

**Description:** Post-refactor improvements that expand assistant coverage and strengthen file cleanup.

| Task ID | Description | Importance | Status | Dependencies |
|:--------|:------------|:-----------|:-------|:-------------|
| **E1** | Define Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI assistants with dedicated rule file paths. | P1 | Completed | 3.5 |
| **E2** | Handle cleanup of assistant files and empty parent directories generically. | P1 | Completed | E1 |
| **E3** | Extend CLI and integration tests for new assistant flags. | P1 | Completed | E1 |
| **E4** | Document new assistant support in design spec, CLI flows, README, and task plan. | P1 | Completed | E3 |
| **E5** | Add `bug-report` CLI command linking to the issue tracker. | P3 | Completed | - |

### Enhancement: Kilo Code and Warp Support

**Description:** Added support for the Kilo Code and Warp assistants, which required refactoring the generation logic to handle mode-based subdirectories.

| Task ID | Description | Importance | Status | Dependencies |
|:--------|:------------|:-----------|:-------|:-------------|
| **E6** | Add `kilocode` and `warp` to `assistants.py` and introduce the `has_modes` flag to `AssistantSpec`. | P1 | Completed | E4 |
| **E7** | Refactor `RuleManager._generate_for_assistant` to use the `has_modes` flag for mode-based generation. | P1 | Completed | E6 |
| **E8** | Update unit and integration tests to verify the new mode-based logic and assistant support. | P1 | Completed | E7 |
| **E9** | Enhance integration tests to check for multiple sub-modes and files within them. | P2 | Completed | E8 |
| **E10** | Update design documents to reflect Kilo Code and Warp support. | P2 | Completed | E7 |

### Phase 7: UX Refactor (Decouple Configuration from Application)

| **7.5** | Replace top-level `clean` and `clean-rules` with `project clean` and `project clean-rules`, preserving confirmation prompt for `project clean`. Update references from task **3.6**. | P1 | Completed | 7.3 |
| **7.6** | Review existing tests and remove or update ones tied to implicit sync or deprecated commands. | P1 | Completed | 7.3 |
| **7.7** | Add integration tests for `profiles` and `project` command group workflows. | P0 | Completed | 7.3 |

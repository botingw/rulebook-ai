# Refactoring Task Plan (As Executed)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This document breaks down the work performed during the internal refactoring of the `rulebook-ai` core and CLI components. The objective was to improve code modularity, maintainability, and extensibility by separating declarative assistant specifications from the file-generation engine.

This plan is a historical record of the tasks completed, based on the final design in the [Refactoring Plan](./refactoring_plan.md).

---

### Phase 1: Separate Specification from Logic

**Description:** This phase focused on creating a purely data-driven architecture, separating the "what" (the assistant spec) from the "how" (the generation engine).

| Task ID | Description                                                                              | Importance | Status      | Dependencies      |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------------|
| **1.1** | Define the `AssistantSpec` dataclass in a new `assistants.py` file.                      | P0         | Completed   | -                 |
| **1.2** | Create the `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS` list in `assistants.py` as the single source of truth. | P0         | Completed   | 1.1               |
| **1.3** | Refactor `RuleManager` in `core.py` into a generic engine that interprets `AssistantSpec` data. | P0         | Completed   | 1.2               |
| **1.4** | Implement private generation strategies (`_strategy_flatten_and_number`, etc.) in `RuleManager`. | P0         | Completed   | 1.3               |
| **1.5** | Refactor public methods (`install`, `sync`, `clean_rules`) to be data-driven and compliant with the design spec. | P0         | Completed   | 1.4               |

### Phase 2: Simplify and Automate the CLI

**Description:** This phase refactored the command-line interface to be dynamically generated from the single source of truth, eliminating hardcoded logic.

| Task ID | Description                                                                              | Importance | Status      | Dependencies      |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------------|
| **2.1** | Refactor `cli.py` to dynamically generate assistant flags (e.g., `--cursor`) from `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS`. | P1         | Completed   | 1.2               |
| **2.2** | Simplify `handle_install` and `handle_sync` to pass the list of selected assistants to `RuleManager`. | P1         | Completed   | 1.4, 2.1          |

### Phase 3: Verification and Documentation

**Description:** This final phase ensured that the refactoring was correct, robust, and fully documented.

| Task ID | Description                                                                              | Importance | Status      | Dependencies      |
|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:------------|:------------------|
| **3.1** | Manually test CLI commands to confirm compliance and identify bugs in the new logic.       | P0         | Completed   | 1.5, 2.2          |
| **3.2** | Run the full automated test suite (`pytest`) to identify all regressions.                  | P0         | Completed   | 3.1               |
| **3.3** | Fix all failing integration tests in `test_cli_commands.py` and other files to align with the new CLI behavior. | P0         | Completed   | 3.2               |
| **3.4** | Rewrite the unit tests in `test_rule_manager_unit.py` to validate the new core generation strategies. | P0         | Completed   | 3.3               |
| **3.5** | Update the public design spec (`manage_rules_script_design.md`) to include the new assistant-selection features. | P1         | Completed   | 3.4               |

### Post-Refactor Feature Addition

**Description:** Subsequent work added support for more AI coding assistants beyond the original refactor phases.

| Task ID | Description | Importance | Status | Dependencies |
|:--------|:------------|:-----------|:-------|:-------------|
| **PR-1** | Introduce Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI to `SUPPORTED_ASSISTANTS`, CLI flags, and cleanup logic. | P1 | Completed | - |
| **PR-2** | Update design docs, README, and tests to document and validate the new assistant support. | P1 | Completed | PR-1 |

context of this plan

user:
this PRD and spec is my rulebook-ai's core goal and feature for now, I want to exapand support of multiple rulesets and enable users to sync selected multiple rulesets to his AI Coding Assistants (cursor, windsurf, etc),  For example, I can at the same time sync project manager rule and frontend developer rule to Cursor and Cline. But you see now, my source folder includes rulesets folder (many rulesets in this folder), and the memory folder, and the tool folder. So it means they share the same memory and tool setup. but perhaps my project manager ruleset need pm_project_docs folder and examples folder (and of course need different tools in tools folder), and ai agent developer rule need other tools. (I think perhaps context can put in memory but subfolders in memory folder and tool folder must be different), how do I redesign source folder structure and Target Project Rules Directory (A folder named project_rules/ created inside users' Target Repo by the install command, which are wait for sync to ai coding assistants). use first principle approach to think and reflect your and revise your answer before submit until your answer is good enough. show me your first principles as well.

user:
here is my questions to chatgpt and his reply, see if his reply improve your design. think with first principle approach, you don't need follow his ideas if you think that idea not good enough or not appropriate to integrate with your plan. here is our conversation.
me: 1. what does compose do? it seems install or sync can directly copy to cursorrule/rules/... GEMINI.md, .clinerule/rules/..., etc. 2. runners/ folder seems too limited. a ruleset could have complicated language tools or setup. whether it is better use README.md in a ruleset to instruct user to configure the rules and corresponding tools/memory? should this runner required? 3. what is compat in manifest.yaml ? 4. for description of a ruleset, is manifest.yaml enough? 5. for "Generate per-pack user guides and an index under composed/user_guide/.", what is user_guides here? I think not rules right? is it like README for a ruleset? 6. what does COMBINED.md do?

gemini-2.5-pro:
Of course. This is an excellent and crucial design challenge that gets to the heart of creating a truly powerful and flexible framework. Your insight is spot on: a monolithic `memory/` and `tools/` structure is too rigid when dealing with distinct, specialized roles or "personas" for the AI.

Let's use a first-principles approach to redesign the framework.

### First Principles for a Multi-RuleSet Framework

1.  **Modularity & Encapsulation:** Each distinct AI "persona" or "role" (like 'Project Manager' or 'Frontend Developer') should be a self-contained unit. This unit must bundle its own specific rules, its required memory/documentation starters, and its necessary tools. This prevents a frontend-focused rule set from being polluted with project management templates.
2.  **Composability:** A user's project is not monolithic. A developer often wears multiple hats. The framework must allow the user to *compose* a final AI context by selecting and combining multiple modular personas. The system should intelligently merge these selected units.
3.  **Clarity of State:** The target project must have a clear, machine-readable source of truth that defines which personas are currently active. This avoids ambiguity and makes commands like `sync` and `clean` deterministic.
4.  **Separation of Concerns:**
    *   **Source vs. Target:** The source repository should be structured for easy *maintenance and creation* of personas. The target repository should be structured for easy *use and customization* by the developer.
    *   **Managed vs. User-Owned:** The framework should clearly distinguish between files it manages (which can be overwritten) and files the user owns and modifies (which should be preserved). The user's customized `memory/` documents are sacred.
5.  **Predictable Merging:** When composing multiple personas, conflicts are inevitable (e.g., two personas provide a `README.md` template). The system must have a simple, predictable, and transparent rule for resolving these conflicts.

### The Redesign: From "Rule Sets" to "Profiles"

Based on these principles, we will evolve the concept of a "Rule Set" into a more comprehensive "Profile." A Profile is an encapsulated package containing everything needed for a specific AI persona.

#### 1. Revised Source Repository Structure

The source repository will be reorganized to encapsulate each profile's dependencies within its own directory.

```
your-rulebook-ai-framework/
│
├── profiles/
│   ├── project-manager/
│   │   ├── rules/              # Core AI instruction files for this profile
│   │   │   ├── 01_role.md
│   │   │   └── 02_tasks.md
│   │   ├── memory_starters/    # Documentation templates specific to this profile
│   │   │   ├── pm_project_docs/
│   │   │   │   └── project_brief_template.md
│   │   │   └── examples/
│   │   │       └── user_story_example.md
│   │   └── tool_starters/      # Tools/scripts specific to this profile
│   │       └── generate_gantt_chart.py
│   │
│   └── frontend-developer/
│       ├── rules/
│       │   ├── 01_role.md
│       │   ├── 02_tech_stack.md
│       │   └── 03_component_structure.md
│       ├── memory_starters/
│       │   ├── design_system/
│       │   │   └── color_palette.md
│       │   └── component_library/
│       │       └── button_component_spec.md
│       └── tool_starters/
│           └── create_component.sh
│
├── src/
│   └── manage_profiles.py      # Script is renamed to reflect the new concept
│
└── ... (other framework files)
```

**Key Change:** `rule_sets/`, `memory_starters/`, and `tool_starters/` are no longer at the root. Instead, each subdirectory inside `profiles/` contains its own `rules/`, `memory_starters/`, and `tool_starters/`.

#### 2. Revised Target Project Structure

The target project will now have a dedicated, hidden directory (e.g., `.rulebook-ai/`) to manage the state and source files of the active profiles. This keeps the project root clean.

```
your-target-project/
│
├── .rulebook-ai/               # Hidden directory managed by the script
│   ├── active_profiles.json    # The new source of truth for active profiles
│   └── profiles/               # A copy of the active profile sources
│       ├── project-manager/
│       │   └── ... (rules, memory_starters, tool_starters)
│       └── frontend-developer/
│           └── ... (rules, memory_starters, tool_starters)
│
├── memory/                     # User-owned, persistent project context
│   ├── pm_project_docs/
│   │   └── project_brief_template.md
│   ├── design_system/
│   │   └── color_palette.md
│   └── ...
│
├── tools/                      # User-owned, persistent project tools
│   ├── generate_gantt_chart.py
│   └── create_component.sh
│
├── .cursor/                    # Generated platform rules (add to .gitignore)
│   └── rules/
│       └── ...
└── .clinerules/                # Generated platform rules (add to .gitignore)
```

**Key Changes:**

*   **`project_rules/` is gone.** It is replaced by the more robust `.rulebook-ai/profiles/` structure.
*   A new state file, `.rulebook-ai/active_profiles.json`, tracks which profiles are installed and in what order. This is crucial for the `sync` and `remove` commands.
*   The top-level `memory/` and `tools/` directories are still the user's primary workspace, but they are now populated from *multiple* source profiles.

#### 3. Revised `manage_profiles.py` Commands

The script's commands need to be updated to manage a collection of profiles rather than a single rule set.

*   **`list`** (replaces `list-rules`)
    *   **Action:** Scans the Source Repository's `profiles/` directory and lists the names of all available profiles.

*   **`add <target_repo_path> <profile_name> [<profile_name_2>...]`** (replaces `install`)
    *   **Action:** For each `<profile_name>`:
        1.  Copies the corresponding profile directory from the Source `profiles/` to the Target's `.rulebook-ai/profiles/`.
        2.  Adds the profile name to `.rulebook-ai/active_profiles.json`.
        3.  If this is the first profile added, it also copies `env.example` and `requirements.txt`.
    *   After adding all specified profiles, it automatically runs the `sync` logic.
    *   **Output:** Confirms which profiles were added.

*   **`remove <target_repo_path> <profile_name> [<profile_name_2>...]`** (New command)
    *   **Action:** For each `<profile_name>`:
        1.  Removes the profile directory from the Target's `.rulebook-ai/profiles/`.
        2.  Removes the profile name from `.rulebook-ai/active_profiles.json`.
    *   After removing all specified profiles, it automatically runs the `sync` logic to regenerate the context without the removed profiles.
    *   **Output:** Confirms which profiles were removed.

*   **`status <target_repo_path>`** (New command)
    *   **Action:** Reads `.rulebook-ai/active_profiles.json` and lists the currently active profiles in their merge order.

*   **`sync <target_repo_path> [--cursor] [--cline] ... [--all]`**
    *   **Action:** This command is now much more powerful.
        1.  Reads the list and order of profiles from `.rulebook-ai/active_profiles.json`.
        2.  **Clean Generated Rules:** Deletes all existing Target Platform Rules (`.cursor/`, `.clinerules/`, etc.).
        3.  **Merge Memory & Tools (Non-destructive):** Iterates through the active profiles in order. For each file/directory in a profile's `memory_starters/` and `tool_starters/`, it copies it to the root `memory/` and `tools/` *only if it does not already exist*. The first profile to provide a file "wins." This respects user modifications to existing files.
        4.  **Merge & Generate Rules:** Collects all rule files from the `rules/` directory of *every* active profile. It then concatenates them (respecting the order from `active_profiles.json`) and generates the final Target Platform Rules for the selected AI assistants.
    *   **Output:** Prints progress, including which profiles are being synced and a notice about the merge strategy (first-wins for memory/tools).

*   **`clean <target_repo_path> [--force]`** (replaces `clean-rules` and `clean-all`)
    *   **Action:** Removes all generated Target Platform Rules. Prompts the user if they also want to remove the entire `.rulebook-ai/` management directory, `memory/`, `tools/`, etc. The `--force` flag can bypass the prompt for a full clean.

### Example Workflow with the New Design

1.  **A developer starts a new project:**
    `python manage_profiles.py add ./my-project project-manager frontend-developer`

2.  **What happens:**
    *   The script creates `./my-project/.rulebook-ai/`.
    *   It copies the full `project-manager` and `frontend-developer` profiles into `./my-project/.rulebook-ai/profiles/`.
    *   It creates `./my-project/.rulebook-ai/active_profiles.json` with `["project-manager", "frontend-developer"]`.
    *   It runs `sync`:
        *   It populates `./my-project/memory/` with starters from `project-manager` and then adds any non-conflicting starters from `frontend-developer`.
        *   It does the same for `./my-project/tools/`.
        *   It concatenates the rules from both profiles and generates the files for Cursor, CLINE, etc.

3.  **The developer decides they no longer need the PM role:**
    `python manage_profiles.py remove ./my-project project-manager`

4.  **What happens:**
    *   The script removes the `project-manager` profile from `.rulebook-ai/` and its entry from the JSON file.
    *   It re-runs `sync`, which now only uses the `frontend-developer` profile. The generated AI assistant rules are now leaner and more focused. The user-owned `memory/` and `tools/` files that originated from the PM profile are *not* deleted, respecting the user's data.

### Advantages of This Redesigned Approach

*   **Truly Modular:** Each AI persona is fully self-contained, making them easy to create, share, and maintain.
*   **Highly Composable:** Developers can mix and match profiles to perfectly suit the needs of any given project.
*   **Explicit State:** The `active_profiles.json` file provides a clear and reliable record of the project's configuration.
*   **Safe for Users:** The non-destructive "first-wins" merge strategy for `memory/` and `tools/` ensures that user customizations are never accidentally overwritten by adding a new profile.
*   **Scalable:** This structure can easily accommodate dozens of profiles without becoming unmanageable.

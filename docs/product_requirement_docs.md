# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Motive:
To have a comprehensive and optimal Custom User Prompt (Rules) for AI coding. These kind of rules are very much required as the **Quality** of Outputs is a function $[response \, Quality = f(prompt, LLM \, model)]$. Thus, for best performance we need very detailed instructions while also giving the LLM the freedom to explore and learn. 

## Target Audience:
Both people exploring AI without prior knowledge but tasting the AI/LLM/Agents landscape. And experienced folks adapting to and integrating AI in their workflow. As better prompts may lead to better outputs.

## Goals:
*   [TODO] What are the goals of this project?

## Success Metrics:
*   [TODO] How will the success of this project be measured?

## Core Features:
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Respects Cursor, CLINE, RooCode Rule guidelines and mechanisms natively.
2. **Latest Compatibility:** Designed to be compatible with the latest versions of Cursor and CLINE, RooCode.
3. **Minimal Token Usage:** Organized the rule files to be only added when demanded (on-demand-loading).
4. **Common Memory Bank:** A common memory bank for all the AI assistants. This maintains same context across all the AI assistants.
5. **Fundamental Software Engineering Principles:** Ensures that the AI is following the best practices in software development.

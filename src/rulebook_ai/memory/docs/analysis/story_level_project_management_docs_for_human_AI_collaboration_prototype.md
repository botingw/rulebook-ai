# Project Management Documentation Prototype for Single-Story Human-AI Collaboration

**Project Context:** This prototype outlines the minimum necessary documentation and components for efficiently developing a **single User Story** using a collaborative approach between human engineers/experts and an AI coding assistant. The goal is to enable the AI to handle a significant portion of the implementation for this specific Story, with human oversight, guidance, review, and potential intervention.

**Core Principle:** Provide **focused, precise, and easily accessible context and instructions** directly relevant to the target User Story, enabling rapid and accurate AI contribution with minimal friction.

## I. Required Information & Components (Essential for the Story)

These items are considered non-negotiable for efficiently tackling even a single Story with human-AI collaboration.

1.  **The User Story Definition (within a Tracker or Document):**
    *   **Purpose:** Clearly defines the "What" and "Why" of this specific piece of functionality.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Clear, concise Story description (e.g., "As a [User Type], I want [Action], so that [Benefit]").
        *   **Explicit Acceptance Criteria (AC):** Precise, testable conditions that *must* be met for the Story to be considered "Done." Covers core functionality, expected inputs/outputs, and key boundary conditions relevant to this Story.
        *   *(Optional but helpful)* Link to the parent Epic or broader context if available and relevant.
    *   **AI Relevance:** Primary input defining the goal. AI needs unambiguous AC to work effectively.
    *   **Human Relevance:** Standard definition of the work unit.

2.  **Task Breakdown for the Story (within Tracker or linked list):**
    *   **Purpose:** Decomposes the Story into smaller, actionable technical tasks suitable for assignment (to AI or human).
    *   **Content:** List of specific tasks (e.g., "Create API endpoint," "Implement validation logic," "Write unit tests for X," "Update UI component Y," "Integrate service Z").
    *   **AI Relevance:** Tasks assigned to AI must be:
        *   **Well-defined:** Clear scope and objective for *that task*.
        *   **Linked Context (Critical):** Direct links to specific sections of requirements/specs, relevant code snippets, applicable standards/patterns (see #3 below), or necessary data models *needed for that task*.
    *   **Human Relevance:** Organizes the work, allows clear assignment (Human/AI), and tracks progress within the Story.

3.  **Task Execution Context & Specifications (Provided or Linked):**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains the detailed "How" and the technical guardrails necessary to implement the tasks correctly *for this Story*. This replaces the need to parse large, project-wide documents for a single Story.
    *   **Content (Needs to be directly accessible/linked from Tasks):**
        *   **Detailed Specs (if needed beyond AC):** Any specific business rules, algorithms, precise UI behavior, or error handling logic required *for this Story's tasks*.
        *   **Relevant Architecture/Design Snippets:** If the Story involves specific components, provide links or brief descriptions of their relevant interfaces or interactions (no need for the full `architecture.md`).
        *   **Applicable Coding Standards/Patterns:** Explicitly state or link to the specific standards (e.g., naming conventions, error handling patterns, security requirements) that *must* be followed for the code related to *this Story*.
        *   **Relevant Existing Code References:** Links to specific files or functions the AI needs to interact with or modify.
        *   **API Definitions / Data Models (if applicable):** Precise definitions needed for the Story's implementation.
    *   **AI Relevance:** **Mission-critical.** This provides the detailed, focused technical instructions and constraints the AI needs *without* irrelevant project-wide noise. Must be clear and readily parsable.
    *   **Human Relevance:** Provides the necessary technical details for implementation or review. Humans ensure this context is accurate and sufficient for the AI.

4.  **Defined Interaction Protocol (for this Story/Session):**
    *   **Purpose:** Establishes the immediate rules of engagement between the human and AI *for this specific piece of work*.
    *   **Content (Can be a brief agreement):**
        *   **Review Cadence:** How often will the human review AI output (e.g., after each task, specific checkpoints)?
        *   **Clarification Channel:** How does the AI ask questions (e.g., specific prompt, comment in code)? What's the expected human response time?
        *   **Error Handling:** What happens if the AI gets stuck or produces incorrect code? (e.g., Human debugs, AI switches to Debug mode with human input).
        *   **Handoff Points (if anticipated):** Any known points where the work will switch from AI to human?
    *   **AI Relevance:** Sets expectations for interaction loops.
    *   **Human Relevance:** Defines the immediate collaborative workflow.

5.  **Testing Requirements (for this Story):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines how the successful implementation of *this Story* will be verified.
    *   **Content:** Specific unit tests the AI should generate, integration points the human needs to test, manual testing steps, required code coverage target (if applicable) *for the code changed/added by this Story*.
    *   **AI Relevance:** Provides clear targets for test generation tasks.
    *   **Human Relevance:** Defines the scope of validation needed for the Story.

## II. Optional (but Helpful) Information

These can add useful context or improve the process, even for a single Story, but might be omitted for very simple Stories.

6.  **Brief Story Context / Link to Goal:**
    *   **Purpose:** Remind AI/human *why* this Story is being built, linking it briefly to a larger feature or user need.
    *   **Content:** Short sentence or link to relevant Epic/feature description.

7.  **Relevant Prior Decisions (if applicable):**
    *   **Purpose:** If a specific past decision (e.g., choice of a library, a specific pattern) directly impacts *how* this Story must be implemented, link to or summarize that decision.
    *   **Content:** Link to Decision Log entry or brief note.

8.  **Quick Human-AI Check-ins:**
    *   **Purpose:** Short, informal syncs during the implementation of the Story to review progress, unblock the AI, or adjust task details.
    *   **Content:** Not formal documentation, but a recommended practice. Outputs (clarifications, decisions) should be captured in task comments or specs.

## Rationale for Single-Story Prototype:

*   **Focus and Minimization:** Eliminates project-wide overhead (Charter, Roadmap, full Risk Register, etc.) not strictly necessary for implementing one specific Story.
*   **Contextualization:** Emphasizes providing *only the relevant parts* of specifications, architecture, and standards needed *for this Story*, often via direct links or snippets within task descriptions.
*   **Actionability:** Prioritizes clear, unambiguous task definitions, AC, technical context, and testing requirements directly linked to the work items.
*   **Immediate Interaction:** Focuses on defining the human-AI workflow specifically for completing *this Story*.
*   **Scalability:** While minimal, this structure provides the core elements that would be expanded upon if the scope grew beyond a single Story.

This lean approach ensures the AI gets the precise information it needs to be productive on the immediate task, while the human provides targeted context, oversight, and handles complexities beyond the AI's scope for that Story.
